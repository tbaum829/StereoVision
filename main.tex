\maketitle

\section{Motivation and Problem Setting}
This should be similar to introductions of the papers you are reading.  You want the reader to become interested in the general topic and describe the main challenge(s) the paper will solve.  Usually this starts out a little broad and then narrows down on a specific problem or challenge.

\section{Related Work}
This should include a substantive critique of all three selected papers.  It may be good to subdivide this section into subsections for each of the three papers as follows.

\section{Solution Approach}
This should define and describe the algorithm you have implemented and give insight into why it works.

\section{Implementation}
This will have your implementation details such as which library you used, what was the high-level structure of your program, and/or what are the core computational aspects considered in your implementation.  This should also include a discussion of comparison to other code that is available for the method you implemented and how your code differs.

\section{Evaluation / Experiments}
This should include any experiments you performed and results in tabular or graph format along with clear and concise descriptions of your results.  Seek to answer the questions "Why is this interesting?" or "Why should anyone care about these results?" rather than merely describing the results or merely stating which one was better.

\section{Conclusion / Discussion}
This final section should include any thoughts, insights or possible extensions you have considered based on your implementation and/or experiments.  You could suggest future directions.  You should also summarize your main findings in a few sentences.  If your experiments seemed to fail or didn't meet your hypotheses, then you can discuss reasons why you believe your experiments didn't seem to work. \citep{luo2016efficient} \citep{yao2018mvsnet} \citep{yu2017single} \citep{duggal2019deeppruner} \citep{barnes2009patchmatch}
